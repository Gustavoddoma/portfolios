        "I served a full-time mission for The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in the northern part of Brazil, specifically in the states of Amazonas and Acre. During my mission, I helped people come closer to Christ through teachings focused on faith, repentance, baptism, receiving the Holy Ghost, and enduring to the end. This experience was transformative for me personally, as I learned valuable skills in interpersonal communication, cultural understanding, and personal growth. My time in Brazil allowed me to develop a deeper sense of empathy and resilience, which continue to influence my interactions with others.",
