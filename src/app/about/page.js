            "I began my education at the Federal University of ParanÃ¡ (UFPR) in Brazil, where I pursued a major in Biomedical Informatics. During my time at UFPR, I participated in the front-end development team at a junior company associated with the university. In this unpaid position, I worked on several institutional website and mobile application projects, utilizing technologies such as React Native, Vue.js, HTML5, and CSS to create intuitive and user-friendly interfaces. This experience helped me develop my technical skills and provided a strong foundation in front-end development.",
            "Before continuing my academic journey, I served a full-time mission for The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in the northern part of Brazil, specifically in the states of Amazonas and Acre. During my mission, I focused on helping people come closer to Christ through teachings on faith, repentance, baptism, receiving the Holy Ghost, and enduring to the end. This transformative experience taught me valuable skills in interpersonal communication, cultural understanding, empathy, and resilience, which continue to influence my interactions with others.",
            "Upon returning from my mission, I embarked on a new educational path at Ensign College, where I am currently studying Computer Science. In addition to my studies, I work as the front desk representative at the Student Success Center, assisting students in connecting with academic advisors, success coaches, peer mentors, and tutors. My goal is to ensure that students have access to the resources and guidance they need to achieve success in their college journey.",
            "Looking ahead, I aspire to transfer my studies to Brigham Young University (BYU), building on my experiences and continuing to grow both academically and personally. I am eager to explore new opportunities, expand my knowledge, and contribute positively to the community around me."
